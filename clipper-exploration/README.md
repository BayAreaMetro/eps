1. [eCash vs Pass Analysis](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/usf-practicum/blob/master/clipper-exploration/eCash%20vs%20Pass%20Exploration.ipynb) - This analysis looks into the question whether users take more rides when they have a pass or when they use eCash. The idea was to look only at users who have switched between eCash and pass to control for all other confounding variables. Additionally, we filtered for users who have taken enough rides to show a pattern. Note that this analysis does not show a causal relationship (passes cause users to take more rides), it just shows the correlation (people take more rides when they have a pass). Analysis is focused on 2015-2016 transactions data for Muni.
